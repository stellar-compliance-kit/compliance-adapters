# Contributing to compliance-adapters

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This repo is the off-chain integration layer for the
[compliance-primitives](https://github.com/stellar-compliance-kit/compliance-primitives) Soroban
contracts, and it's intentionally structured to have lots of small, well-scoped issues — a good
entry point if you're comfortable with TypeScript/Node but don't (yet) know Soroban internals.

## Drips Wave Stellar Program

This repo participates in the [Drips Wave](https://www.drips.network/) Stellar Program. Issues
are labeled by complexity so you can pick work that matches your available time and experience:

- `complexity: trivial` — small, self-contained, usually a few lines or a single test. Also
  tagged `good first issue`.
- `complexity: medium` — a feature or integration that touches one package meaningfully.
- `complexity: high` — cross-package design work, new abstractions, or security-sensitive changes.

Check open issues for the current bounty/reward status under the Drips Wave program before
starting work, and comment on an issue to claim it so we don't get duplicate PRs.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellar-compliance-kit/compliance-adapters.git
cd compliance-adapters
npm install
npm test
```

Each package under the repo root (`sep10-auth/`, `sanctions-oracle/`, `horizon-listener/`) is an
independent npm workspace with its own `package.json`, `README.md`, and test suite. Run a single
package's tests with:

```bash
npm test --workspace=sep10-auth
```

## Development workflow

1. Fork the repo and create a branch off `main`.
2. Make your change, keeping it scoped to the linked issue.
3. Add or update tests — PRs that touch behavior without test coverage will be asked to add it.
4. Run `npm run lint` and `npm test` locally before opening a PR.
5. Open a PR referencing the issue number (`Fixes #123`) and describe what you changed and why.

## Code style

- TypeScript, Node 20+. Formatting is enforced by Prettier/ESLint (`npm run lint`).
- Prefer small, focused functions and explicit types on exported APIs.
- Don't vendor `compliance-primitives` contract code here — reference it as a dependency/link.

## Branch protection and required status checks

The `main` branch has branch protection enabled. **The CI workflow must be green before any PR
can be merged** — GitHub will block the merge button if the required status check hasn't passed.

The required check is the **"Lint & Test (TypeScript)"** job defined in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It runs `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` across all
workspaces. All three steps must succeed for the check to pass.

What this means in practice:

- A red CI run is not just a warning — the PR is blocked until the check goes green.
- If you push a fix and CI still fails, push another commit; GitHub re-evaluates the check on
  every push to the PR branch.
- If the run looks like a flake (network timeout, rate-limit, etc.), use the **"Re-run failed
  jobs"** button on the Actions tab. Do not merge around a legitimate failure by temporarily
  disabling the rule — contact a maintainer if you believe the failure is environmental.
- Draft PRs are not blocked, but converting a draft to "Ready for review" will not remove the
  check requirement. The check still needs to be green before merge.

If you're unsure why CI is red, look at the failing step's log in the Actions tab; the lint and
build steps usually have the clearest error messages.

## Reporting bugs / requesting features

Use the issue templates under **New Issue** — one for bug reports, one for feature requests.

## Security

Please do not open a public issue for suspected security vulnerabilities in the sanctions-oracle
sync path, SEP-10 verification logic, or webhook handling. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) (once
published) or contact the maintainers directly.
