## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **sep10-auth** — rate limiting middleware for challenge/verify endpoints, session revocation
  via `RevocationStore`, and `client_domain` verification support.
- **sanctions-oracle** — `ProviderRegistry` for falling back across multiple sanctions data
  sources, `CsvSanctionsProvider` for CSV-backed watchlists, `RateLimitedSanctionsProvider`
  wrapper, `withRetry` retry-with-backoff helper, and metrics/tracing instrumentation around
  sync runs.
- **horizon-listener** — HMAC webhook request signing, stream/poll event source modes, and
  metrics/tracing instrumentation around event polling and webhook delivery.
- **backoff** — shared `@compliance-adapters/backoff` package extracting the exponential-backoff
  formula previously duplicated across `horizon-listener` and `sanctions-oracle`.
- End-to-end test suite (`e2e-tests`) exercising the packages against a live Soroban RPC/Horizon
  stack.
