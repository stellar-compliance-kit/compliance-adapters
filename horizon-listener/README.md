# horizon-listener

An example/reference service that polls Soroban RPC for contract events emitted
by the `denylist-gate` and `allowlist-token` contracts, logs them, and
re-emits them to a webhook. Soroban RPC's `getEvents` is a cursor-based polling
API — there is no persistent server-sent-events stream for contract events at
that layer — so this package polls on an interval and tracks a cursor between
calls rather than holding open a live connection. "Reconnect" here means the
polling loop hit an error (RPC unreachable, rate-limited, cursor expired) and
backed off before retrying, not a literal TCP reconnect. This package
demonstrates the integration pattern app developers would build on top of;
it is not itself a production event pipeline.

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

(This package is part of the `compliance-adapters` npm workspace; run install
from the repo root.)

## Quick example

```ts
import { Networks } from '@stellar/stellar-sdk';
import { RpcEventSource, HorizonListener, HttpWebhookSender } from 'horizon-listener';

const eventSource = new RpcEventSource({
  rpcUrl: 'https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org',
  networkPassphrase: Networks.TESTNET,
  contractIds: [process.env.DENYLIST_GATE_CONTRACT_ID!, process.env.ALLOWLIST_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID!],
});

const webhook = new HttpWebhookSender({
  url: 'http://localhost:4000/webhook',
  signingSecret: process.env.WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET,
});

const listener = new HorizonListener({
  eventSource,
  pollIntervalMs: 5000,
  onEvent: async (event) => {
    await webhook.send(event);
  },
});

listener.start().catch((err) => {
  console.error('horizon-listener gave up after repeated failures', err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

A minimal stub receiver to point `HttpWebhookSender` at during local
development (using [Express](https://expressjs.com/), not a dependency of this
package):

```ts
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  console.log('received event', req.body);
  res.sendStatus(200);
});
app.listen(4000);
```

## Polling mode vs stream mode

`HorizonListener` supports two polling modes via the `mode` option:

- **`poll`** (default) — fixed-interval polling. The listener always waits
  `pollIntervalMs` between each `getEvents` call, regardless of whether events
  were returned. Suitable for most use cases.

- **`stream`** — backoff-only "stream-like" mode. The listener polls again
  immediately after processing a full page of events, and only sleeps
  `pollIntervalMs` when a poll returns no new events. This reduces latency for
  high-activity contracts without hammering the RPC during quiet periods.

```ts
const listener = new HorizonListener({
  eventSource,
  onEvent: async (event) => { /* ... */ },
  mode: 'stream',      // or 'poll' (default)
  pollIntervalMs: 5000, // sleep duration during quiet periods
});
```

## Webhook signature verification

When `HttpWebhookSender` is constructed with a `signingSecret`, every outbound
request carries an `X-Signature` header of the form:

```
X-Signature: sha256=<hex-encoded HMAC-SHA256 of the raw request body, keyed by signingSecret>
```

The HMAC is computed over the exact JSON string sent as the request body
(before any parsing), so a receiver must verify against the raw bytes, not a
re-serialized version of the parsed body — re-serializing can change key
order or whitespace and produce a different digest.

A receiver should recompute the HMAC over the raw body with the shared
secret and compare it to the header using a constant-time comparison (to
avoid leaking the secret through timing differences), rejecting the request
if they don't match or if the header is missing:

```ts
import { createHmac, timingSafeEqual } from 'node:crypto';
import express from 'express';

const WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET = process.env.WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET!;

const app = express();

// Capture the raw body bytes for HMAC verification before JSON parsing.
app.use(express.json({ verify: (req, _res, buf) => {
  (req as express.Request & { rawBody?: Buffer }).rawBody = buf;
} }));

function isValidSignature(rawBody: Buffer, header: string | undefined): boolean {
  if (!header) return false;

  const expected = createHmac('sha256', WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET).update(rawBody).digest('hex');
  const expectedHeader = `sha256=${expected}`;

  const a = Buffer.from(header);
  const b = Buffer.from(expectedHeader);
  return a.length === b.length && timingSafeEqual(a, b);
}

app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const rawBody = (req as express.Request & { rawBody?: Buffer }).rawBody ?? Buffer.alloc(0);

  if (!isValidSignature(rawBody, req.header('X-Signature'))) {
    return res.sendStatus(401);
  }

  console.log('received event', req.body);
  res.sendStatus(200);
});
app.listen(4000);
```

If `signingSecret` is omitted, `HttpWebhookSender` sends requests without an
`X-Signature` header, exactly as before this feature was added.

## Reconnect / backoff behavior

If `eventSource.getEvents(...)` throws (RPC unreachable, rate-limited, cursor
expired, etc.), `HorizonListener` does not crash: it logs a warning, waits an
exponentially increasing backoff delay (see `computeBackoffDelayMs` in
`src/backoff.ts`, capped at 30s by default with jitter), and retries. The
retry counter resets to zero after any subsequent successful poll. If
`maxRetries` consecutive failures are exceeded (default 10), `start()`
rejects so the caller knows the listener gave up — in a real deployment a
process manager would be responsible for restarting the process.

Individual `onEvent` handler errors are caught and logged without stopping
the polling loop, so one bad event doesn't take down the whole listener.

## Logging

All logging is routed through an injectable `Logger` interface with a default
console-backed implementation. Log levels are used semantically:

- **debug** — Cursor advancement and other low-level operational details
- **info** — Successful event reception (one log per event received)
- **warn** — Recoverable poll failures with automatic retry (e.g., RPC unreachable, rate-limited)
- **error** — Handler errors and critical listener failures

Pass a custom `Logger` instance to `HorizonListener` options to customize
output (e.g., to route to a production logging service).
